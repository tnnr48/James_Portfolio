# [Project 1: Data Science on Taric Jungle Games in League of Legends. Project Overview](https://github.com/jbooth23/Taric-Jungle-General-Data/blob/main/Taric%20Games)

* Collected data on 1900 League of Legends solo queue games in 2021 for a single player across several statistics including wins, losses, jungle matchups and respective win rates, runes, as well as item and build specific win rates. 
* Collected more specific data for a sample of 301 League of Legends games across 22 variables including all variables for the larger dataset as well as data on objectives, game times, kills, deaths, and assists.
* Tracked data for 830 games for a specific build. Calculated daily, weekly, and monthly win rate results.
* Modeled summary statistics via barplots, histograms, and boxplots in R. Also modeled data using Tableau and PowerBI.
* Created linear and correlation models to identify any existing relationships between variables in R and Python. Identified high correlation and linearity between two powerful predictive variables, excluded them from the model as a result.
* Divided 301 game sample into training and test observations (n = 150 and n = 151 respectively) using validation. Used R to develop a logistic regression model to identify variables most associated with winning or losing games. Identified six variables: kills, deaths, assists, baron, dragon advantage, and kayn with p-values below 0.05 and created a model to accurately classify game results with 92.72% accuracy.
* Used R to create logistic regression models for every individual variable.
* Created a 5 variable tree model for greater interpretability in R. This was 86% accurate for the test data.
* Used the logistic regression model for live in-game win predictions with variable accuracy.
* Researched artificial neural networks (ANNs) and developed a 6 layer network in R, incorporating all 22 variables for win-loss prediction. Tested the network over 50 trials and it returned results with 96.69% accuracy.
* Authored two reports on the player's performance, the analysis of those results, and the mathematics behind linear, logistic regression, and ANNs.
